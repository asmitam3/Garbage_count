Using OpenCV and Python, you can detect plastic objects in images or video streams by employing a pre-trained deep learning model like YOLO (You Only Look Once). After preprocessing the input, the model is used to detect plastic objects, and postprocessing techniques like non-maximum suppression can refine the results.
